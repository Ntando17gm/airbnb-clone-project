# airbnb-clone-project
Project is an Airbnb Clone, developed as part of a my journey in backend. The main objective is to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb, including user authentication, property listings, booking management, and reviews. Through this project, I aim to strengthen my understanding of backend systems, APIs, databases, and frontend integration.
