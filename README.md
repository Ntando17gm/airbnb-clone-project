## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and authorization of users. It ensures secure access to the platform and defines roles such as hosts (who list properties) and guests (who book properties).

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings. Each listing includes details like title, description, location, price per night, and availability, enabling guests to browse options.

### 3. Booking System
Enables guests to reserve properties for specific dates. It manages availability, prevents double bookings, and ensures smooth coordination between hosts and guests.

### 4. Review & Rating System
Provides a way for guests to leave feedback on properties they’ve stayed in. This feature builds trust, helps future guests make informed decisions, and allows hosts to improve their offerings.

### 5. Payment Processing
Manages transactions between guests and hosts. It securely handles payments, tracks booking fees, and records transaction statuses to ensure financial transparency.

### 6. Search & Filtering
Allows users to find properties based on criteria like location, price range, availability, and ratings. This makes the platform user-friendly by helping guests quickly find suitable options.

### 7. Admin Dashboard (Future Feature)
Provides administrators with tools to oversee users, listings, and bookings. It ensures platform integrity by monitoring activity, handling disputes, and enforcing policies.

## API Security

### 1. Authentication
Only verified users can access the platform through secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth2). This ensures that sensitive actions like bookings, reviews, and payments are only performed by legitimate users.  
**Why:** Protects user accounts from unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control will be enforced to differentiate between guests, hosts, and admins. For example, only hosts can create property listings, while only admins can manage disputes.  
**Why:** Prevents unauthorized users from performing restricted actions.

### 3. Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed (e.g., using bcrypt) and communications between the client and server will use HTTPS (TLS).  
**Why:** Protects against data breaches and keeps user information secure during transmission.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
API requests will be rate-limited to prevent abuse such as brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts.  
**Why:** Ensures platform stability and protects against malicious automated requests.

### 5. Secure Payments
Payment data will be handled using trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) rather than storing sensitive financial details on the server.  
**Why:** Ensures financial transactions are processed securely and reduces risk of fraud.

### 6. Input Validation & Sanitization
All inputs (e.g., user registration, property details, search queries) will be validated and sanitized before processing.  
**Why:** Prevents security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and data corruption.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. Continuous Integration ensures that code changes are frequently merged, tested, and verified, while Continuous Deployment automates the release of those changes into production environments.

### Why It’s Important
- **Reliability:** Ensures new code changes don’t break existing functionality by running automated tests.  
- **Speed:** Speeds up development by reducing manual testing and deployment processes.  
- **Consistency:** Provides a standardized, repeatable way to build and deploy the project.  
- **Collaboration:** Helps teams integrate work seamlessly, reducing conflicts and improving code quality.  

### Tools to Be Used
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating workflows such as testing, linting, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker:** For containerizing the application to ensure consistent behavior across development, staging, and production environments.  
- **Heroku / AWS (future deployment):** For hosting the application with automated deployment from the CI/CD pipeline.  
- **pytest / unit testing frameworks:** For running automated tests as part of the pipeline to validate code changes.
